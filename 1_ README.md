# My First Microgame
My microgame is a 3D go-karting game with many different custom features, like jump ramps all around the map, many speed boosts on the track, and a custom map to add complexity. In my game, you can race in a long and dificult trac while trying to get to the end in the least amount of time.

To open and run my game, you have to click on project two in the Unity Hub version 6000.0.40f1. Then once you are in the project, you need to look at the top center of the screen and you will see three buttons. Out of the three, click the on on the very right. Additionally, you can click the three dots on the top right of the screen, and select the maximize option to go fullscreen. To exit fullscreen, you just hit maximize again to minimize.
